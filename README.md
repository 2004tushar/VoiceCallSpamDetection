# VoiceCallSpamDetection  
Spam & Fraudulent Call Detection System using Machine Learning

## 🧾 Project Overview  
VoiceCallSpamDetection is a machine-learning based system designed to detect and flag spam or fraudulent voice calls (and/or messages) by analysing call/text transcripts. With scams, phishing and unwanted calls on the rise, this tool aims to help protect users by automatically classifying calls as **spam** or **legitimate**.

## 🎯 Purpose  
- To reduce financial and personal data risks associated with scam/phishing calls.  
- To provide an automated solution rather than manual filtering of suspicious calls.  
- To demonstrate how machine learning and NLP techniques can be applied to real-world telecom security problems.

## 🛠️ Features & Methodology  
- Data collection: A dataset of labelled calls/texts relevant to spam detection.  
- Data preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing data, handling missing or irrelevant entries (my primary role).  
- Machine-learning algorithms evaluated: Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM) – SVM achieved the best accuracy.  
- Deployment: Model converted (if applicable) to a lightweight format for integration into applications.  
- Report & documentation: Full project report detailing methodology, experiments, results and future scope.

## 👥 My Role  
- Identified and selected a dataset that fits the spam-call detection problem.  
- Cleaned the dataset: removed missing values, filtered irrelevant records, and formatted data for model training and testing.  
- Co-authored the project report, documenting the workflow, experiments and findings.  
- Worked collaboratively with the team, who implemented model training, evaluation and integration.
